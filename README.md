## High Throughput Screening analysis for Calcium associated Chloride Channels

# Goal
Analyze high throughput screening data for compounds that activate calcium activated chloride channels. Using the hits from this to determine potential therapeutics for many diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and asthma.

# Assay for Compound Screening
Each compound used was evaluated by YFP fluorescence ratios which were normalized with negative controls. The authors state that if the compound casuses less than negative 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds then that compound is considered active and a potentiator of TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels.
